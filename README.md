## 📊 Statistical Analysis of the GenImage Dataset

This project provides a complete statistical exploration of a GenImage-like dataset, containing AI-generated and natural images across multiple generators and splits. The goal is to quantify structural, color, and distribution differences between classes, as well as to generate reproducible analysis outputs in the form of tables, figures, and logs.

The project was developed as part of an academic assignment requiring:
✔ statistical analysis
✔ clear documentation
✔ visualizations and tables
✔ an oral presentation summarizing the results

## 🚀 Overview

The analysis script (analyze_genimage.py) automatically scans the dataset, extracts meaningful statistics, and generates:

1. Tables (CSV)

- Total image counts per generator, split, and class

- Sampled image-level statistics (width, height, aspect ratio, RGB means, RGB standard deviations, luminance)

2. Figures (PNG)

- Image count bar charts

- Histograms of image width and height

- Aspect-ratio category distributions

- Luminance boxplots per class

- 2D PCA projection of simple image statistics (AI vs. Nature)

3. Logs (.log)

Each run automatically creates a timestamped log file containing:

- dataset paths

- counts and sampling procedures

- warnings for unreadable images

- saved output paths

- execution progress

All logs are stored inside output/logs/.

## 🧠 What the Script Analyzes

For each generator, split (train / val), and class (ai / nature), the script collects:

- Image-level statistics

- Width and height

- Aspect ratio and aspect-ratio category

- Mean RGB values

- Standard deviation of RGB channels

- Approximate perceived luminance

- Dataset-level insights

- Size imbalance across generators

- Class differences in structure and color

- Typical image shapes (1:1, 4:3, 16:9, wide, tall)

- Differences visible in PCA space

The script also performs controlled sampling to avoid overloading memory when a generator contains thousands of images.

## 📁 Output

The script automatically generates three output directories:

##### 1.- output/tables/

Contains:

- image_counts.csv

- image_stats_sample.csv

##### 2.- output/figures/

Contains:

- Bar charts

- Histograms

- Aspect ratio plots

- Luminance boxplots

- PCA visualization

##### 3.- output/logs/

Contains timestamped log files such as:

- analysis_20251205_192004.log

## ▶️ How to Run the Analysis

Use the following command example:
```bash
python src\analyze_genimage.py `
  --root ".\data\GenImage" `
  --generators generador1_ADM_descomprimido generador2_BigGAN_descomprimido generador3_glide_descomprimido `
  --splits train val `
  --sample_per_class 500 `
  --output_dir ".\output"
```
###### Arguments
Argument	Description:
- --root -> Root directory containing the generator folders
- --generators -> Generator folders to analyze
- --splits -> Dataset splits (default: train, val)
- --sample_per_class -> Number of images to sample per class for detailed stats
- --output_dir -> Output directory for tables, figures, and logs

## 🧪 Reproducibility

The script uses:

- consistent random seeds for sampling

- deterministic PCA

- fixed bins for histograms

This ensures that running the analysis on the same dataset produces identical results.

## 📌 Requirements

Install the necessary Python packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## 🎓 Academic Notes

This project forms part of a statistical analysis assignment.
The final deliverables are:

- A written report describing the methods and results

- The statistical outputs generated by the script

- An oral presentation (10–15 minutes)

The dataset itself is not included in this repository, and only directory placeholders are stored to preserve structure.
